📧 Email Breach Information Dashboard
Overview 🛡️
This project is a web-based dashboard that allows users to scan emails for potential breaches using the BreachDirectory API. Users can upload a list of emails in Excel or CSV format, which will be checked against breach databases. The results, including breach details, will be stored in a MongoDB database and displayed in the dashboard.

Features 🚀
Upload Email List: Upload a CSV or Excel file containing a list of email addresses.
Scan for Breaches: Scan emails using the BreachDirectory API to check for data breaches on the dark web.
Save Results: Store the scan results in a MongoDB database for easy access.
Dashboard: View the scanned results in a beautiful, interactive table within the web interface.
